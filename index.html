                <p>Right now, empathy and balance are nominal focus points of the school. It seems that something drastic must change in order to make strides towards a happier environment.</p>
                <p>I think the 4x5 fixes many of the problems the school faces at the cost of crippling many classes, so the 4x5 is better for empathy and balance. However, I think it comes at too high a cost.</p>
                <p>Perhaps by lifting the sport requirement, or offering students another term to slide, students could better manage their time and make their schedules conducive to balance and wellness.</p>
                <p>I think that although the new schedule attempts to be more balanced, four courses are too few and I know that I would miss the variety that 5 to 6 courses allows.</p>
                <p>I don't know because the 4 by 5 is pretty complicated and not as much time is devoted to actual classes, but the current schedule is pretty busy itself.</p>

                <p>With the 4x5 the teachers would think, "Since I don't see them everyday, might as well give them twice the homework." No matter how thin you slice it, that will happen.</p>
                <p>Less homework would help but learning less doesn't make it worth it.</p>
                <p>The focus of the day would be on three courses opposed to potentially six, so there would be less distractions and more specialization.</p>
                <p>What is wrong with the current schedule? All the revised schedule does is make my life more stressful with classes on Saturday, a day reserved for relaxation from the week and athletic contests.</p>
                <p>Less subjects means less different possible kinds of homework to worry about!</p>

                <p>Unsure but possibly 4x5 to eliminate homework stress. This new schedule could potentially take away from the crucial skill building PA students learn oh-so-well during their time here: managing time and prioritizing.</p>
                <p>I think people might think they want something different, but having such long period blocks would wear people out.</p>
                <p>I think that the 4 by 5 would not be good for students who want to take the AP tests because it is hard to remember information if did not just finish the course.</p>
                <p>The current schedule is incredibly old-fashioned. I would be extremely disappointed if the school upholds it. Times have changed and will continue to change. Andover needs to move with these times and be innovative.</p>
                <p>Having clear ends to every term is great for breaks, and just like it is in college. We are a prep school after all.</p>

              <div class='comments'>
                <p>I would like the classes to be 75 minutes long most days, but I would not want all of that time to be spent learning. I would like a portion of that period to be used for homework with the teacher within earshot.</p>
                <p>I would prefer 45 minute classes because I feel like I can pay better attention.</p>
                <p>Some classes only really need 45 minute periods to complete the syllabus, but others, namely science classes, do need the extended time for activities like labs.</p>
                <p>I find that even with classes being 75 minutes long, I receive the same amount, if not more work, as a day with 45 minute long classes.</p>
                <p>Honestly, I'm indifferent but I think most of my peers would enjoy 45 minute periods more.</p>

                <p>Extend period week just adds more stress to the lives of students. It would be much nicer to let the teachers do their own form of exam other than in many cases a dreaded Smith Center department final.</p>
                <p>The extended period week could be very for 3/4 terms to match the three extended period weeks we have now. I think extended period week is important for ingraining information.</p>
                <p>The extended Period Week gives us too much freedom, making it easier for us to get distracted while we should be studying.</p>
                <p>It enables for students to be able to focus on specific subjects at one time and not have an overload of all the courses during exam week.</p>
                <p>I think extended period week is a good model Especially since teachers would still want to give major final assignments, having a week dedicated to only finals would give students adequate time to work on them.</p>

                <p>It's easier to be in the right mindset if each day followed a similar pattern. It's helpful to be in the same schedule.</p>
                <p>I think having each class at the same time each is more conducive to consistent and effective learning, and creates a better routine.</p>
                <p>I like the rhythm of knowing when my class is going to be. It means that at a certain time for day I am mentally ready for each class.</p>
                <p>A daily / weekly schedule, in my opinion, should be a pattern that doesn't break and makes sense. Our current schedule has a clear day to day pattern that makes it easy to know what your day looks like, at any moment.</p>
                <p>That would just be confusing and I see no benefit</p>
